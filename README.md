Scoring Methodology
The AI uses a weighted scoring system based on five key criteria:

Criterion	Default Weight	Description
Technical Skills	30%	Programming languages, frameworks, tools, certifications
Experience	25%	Years of experience, industry background, leadership roles
Education	20%	Degree level, institution reputation, academic performance
Soft Skills	15%	Communication, leadership, problem-solving, teamwork
Portfolio Quality	10%	Project complexity, code quality, innovation, impact
🔌 API Documentation
The backend provides a comprehensive RESTful API:

Key Endpoints
